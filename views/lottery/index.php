			<p>Operation Braveheart's Monthly lottery is run by its founder David John Godfrey and the committee of Operation Braveheart.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Each number purchased must be paid for in advance, on or before the 1st of every month. This can either be paid in advance on a monthly, quarterly, half yearly or a full year basis by standing order or cheque/postal order.  Please, if paying by cheque or postal order this needs to be made out to "Operation Braveheart 100 Club".</p>
			<br />
			<p>If a number is chosen and there is no match (i.e. that number does not have a payment next to it), then the money will be rolled over for the next month, and shared with the next month's winner.</p>
			<br />
			<p>&#163;2.00 per number and you may buy other numbers if you wish.</p>
			<br />
			<p>The winning number paying out up to &#163;100 once a 100 numbers are sold, and if more people join, the bigger the payout and that's every month as long as members stay in the draw.</p>
			<br />
			<p>David will show the winning number via a video on his profile, at the end of the month and will also be announced in the media.</p>
			<br />
			<p>So come on, let's show our support for David and the Bravehearts. All profit made will enable David to get his wonderful idea of the life support mobile vehicle on the road helping our services.</p>
